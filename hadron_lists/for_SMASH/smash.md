# SMASH

## Overview

[SMASH](https://github.com/smash-transport/smash.git) is a relativistic hadronic transport approach for the dynamical description of heavy-ion reactions. It may be used to create the initial conditions for or as an afterburner after hydrodynamic simulations. Alternatively, it may be used to simulate a heavy-ion collision in its entirety.

## List and Decays files

One of the key inputs of SMASH is the hadron particle list, along with particle quantum numbers, properties (mass, width, etc.), and decays. These are specified in two separate files (`list.dat` and `decays.dat`)

### Particle list (`list.dat`)

### Decays (`decays.dat`)

## Description

PDG21+ is a hadron list that contains all hadrons (no charmness) listed on the Review of Particle Physics, along with their quantum numbers and decays. A
collection of Python scripts is provided to help formatting the list for use
with [Thermal-FIST](https://github.com/vlvovch/Thermal-FIST),
[SMASH](https://github.com/smash-transport/smash), and other post-processing tools.

Please see [arXiv:2309.01737 (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01737) for details and cite when using the list.

## Description

PDG2021+ is a hadron list that contains all hadrons (up to strange flavor) listed on the Review of Particle Physics, along with their properties, quantum numbers and decays. A quick comparison to previous lists can be found below.

The list is provided in the appropriate format to be used in [CCAKE](https://github.com/the-nuclear-confectionery/CCAKE.git), [Thermal-FIST](https://github.com/vlvovch/Thermal-FIST),
[SMASH](https://github.com/smash-transport/smash), and [Pythia8](https://pythia.org/).

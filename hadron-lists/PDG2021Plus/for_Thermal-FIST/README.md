# Thermal-FIST

## Overview

[Thermal-FIST](https://github.com/vlvovch/Thermal-FIST.git) is a general-purpose analysis tool that uses the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model for

- Equation of State computation
- Hadron yield (ratios) thermal fits for heavy-ions
- Monte Carlo event generation through Blast-Wave Models

among other applications.

## List and Decays files

One of the key inputs of Thermal-FIST is the hadron particle list, along with particle quantum numbers, properties (mass, width, etc.), and decays. These are specified in two separate files (`list.dat` and `decays.dat`)

### Particle list (`list.dat`)

### Decays (`decays.dat`)
